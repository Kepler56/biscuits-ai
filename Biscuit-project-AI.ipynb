    "<p>The problem at hand is to optimize the production of biscuits from a single roll of dough in a biscuit manufacturing factory for the Christmas season. The factory aims to produce four types of biscuits with different sizes and prices all while using the available roll of dough. The goal is to maximize biscuit production while ensuring the highest possible profit.</p>\n",

The former is from the local search algorithms and the latter a heuristic algorithm. Let's give a small explanation of each algorithm before proceeding by using the course slides.</p>\n",

    "Given a problem, algorithms in the domain make use of a population of solutions (also called states), where each solution/state represents a feasible solution. At each iteration (often called generation), the population gets updated using methods inspired by biology and evolution, like crossover, mutation and natural selection.</p>\n",
